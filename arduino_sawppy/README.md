# Arduino Sawppy Controller
This directory is an Arduino sketch, intending to give Sawppy rover a wired joystick controller
alternative to default WiFi wireless control. Target platform is ATmega328-based Arduino Nano.

Target rover platform is Sawppy V1, based around the LewanSoul/HiWonder LX-16A serial bus servo.
It has not (yet?) been adapted to rovers built on different hardware.
