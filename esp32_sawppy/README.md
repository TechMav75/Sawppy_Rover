# ESP32 Sawppy Brain
This directory is a PlatformIO project for a Sawppy brain built using an ESP32 development kit.
Using the ESP-IDF framework, individual components are organized into FreeRTOS tasks.

This is written to support Micro Sawppy development, which uses generic RC micro servos and
DRV8833 DC motor driver ICs. It is not yet able to support LX-16A serial bus servos used in
Sawppy V1.
